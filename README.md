Привет! 👋

I'm an aspiring developer looking to master various programming languages and create a project in each. Welcome to my code corner,
where I document my progress, share experiences, and track achievements.

*imagine a beautiful banner here and other stylish stuff that i'll add later

## Core Skills

- HTML + CSS + JavaScript and frameworks
- Python
- C++
- Algorithms and data structures
- Mathematics and data analysis
- Well handle the Linux/MacOS terminal
- Can make funny photos :)

## Goal

My main goal is to explore various programming languages, expand my technical toolkit, and build interesting projects for practice and learning.

That's why I came up with a challenge for myself: a project in each of the languages that interest me (or you).
